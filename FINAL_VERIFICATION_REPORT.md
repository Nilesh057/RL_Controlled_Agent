- **Save Method**: Pickle serialization after episodes
- **Load Method**: Automatic loading on agent initialization
- **Verification**: 24 learned states with complex Q-value mappings
- **Proof**: Q-table files exist and contain rich learned data

### ‚úÖ **Item 6: Episodes & Task Variety (40+ tasks, 10+ types)**
**IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive task diversity
- **Episodes**: 5 episodes √ó 8 tasks = 40 training instances
- **Task Types**: 10 different categories (mute, open, play, screenshot, etc.)
- **Variety**: Episode shuffling for better learning
- **Proof**: Latest demo shows varied realistic tasks across all episodes

### ‚úÖ **Item 7: Learning Curve Quality (Professional visualization)**
**IMPLEMENTED**: Enhanced visualization in [agent/visualizer.py](file:///Users/rupesh/Desktop/RL_Controlled_Agent/agent/visualizer.py)
- **Trend Analysis**: Clear learning progression shown
- **Professional Format**: High-resolution PNG with statistics
- **Learning Evidence**: 300% improvement (Episode 1: 5 ‚Üí Episode 5: 20)
- **Proof**: Multiple learning curve files generated with real trend data

### ‚úÖ **Item 8: Demo Video (Completed screen recording)**
**IMPLEMENTED**: User confirmed completion
- **Status**: Screen recording demo video completed by user
- **Content**: Visual demonstration of all RL agent features
- **Value**: Shows real-time learning and user interaction
- **Proof**: User statement: "i have the demo video i had done the screen recording"

### ‚úÖ **Item 9: Reports (Complete documentation with samples)**
**IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive documentation suite
- **Technical Report**: [TECHNICAL_REPORT.md](file:///Users/rupesh/Desktop/RL_Controlled_Agent/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md) with sample logs
