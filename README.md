Follow-up / Next-Best Action Suggestions

Negative Feedback Handling with Correction Prompt

Full Logging (task, intent, action, reward, feedback, confidence, correction, timestamp, etc.)

Q-table Persistence (auto save/load between sessions)

Multiple Tasks & Episodes with variety (15–30+)

Learning Curve Visualization (learning_curve.png)

CLI Demo + Streamlit Dashboard

Voice-to-Text Infrastructure (Optional Bonus — marked as voice-ready)
