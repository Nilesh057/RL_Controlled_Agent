## 🎯 Demo Video Alternative (Text-based)

If video recording is not possible, use this text-based demonstration:

### Create Demo Output File:
```bash
# Run complete demonstration
python3 live_demo.py > demo_output.txt 2>&1

# Add timestamp
echo "Demo completed at: $(date)" >> demo_output.txt
```

### Screenshot Key Visuals:
1. Streamlit interface with feedback buttons
2. Learning curve chart showing improvement
3. CSV file with structured logs
4. Performance dashboard analytics

This provides comprehensive evidence of all implemented features working correctly.
