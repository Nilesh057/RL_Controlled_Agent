  ```
  ❌ Negative feedback recorded.
  💡 CORRECTION REQUIRED: What action should have been taken?
  Available actions: open, close, mute, unmute, screenshot, set_dnd
  📝 Correction recorded: open
  ✅ Q-table updated: open rewarded (+2), wrong_action penalized (-1)
  ```

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging System** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: 17-field CSV logging with enhanced metadata
- **Fields**: Task_ID, Parsed_Intent, Action_Taken, Base_Reward, Total_Reward, Timestamp, Confidence_Score, User_Feedback, Suggested_Correct_Action, Sigmoid_Confidence, Softmax_Confidence, Ranking_Confidence, Follow_up_Task, Follow_up_Accepted, Follow_up_Reward, Chosen_Q_Value, Mean_Other_Q_Values
- **Sample Log Entry**:
  ```csv
  E1-T1,mute,open,-1,0,2025-09-24T12:10:28,0.457,👎,set_dnd,0.5,0.143,1.0,,False,1,0.0,0.0

  ```

### 5. **Q-table Persistence** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: Automatic save/load with pickle serialization
- **Features**: Auto-save after every update, CSV export for analysis, error handling
- **Verification**: 45 learned states with persistent Q-values across sessions
- **Files**: `.pkl` (binary) and `.csv` (human-readable) formats

### 6. **Enhanced Task Variety** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: 35+ diverse tasks across 4 categories
- **Categories**: Communication (10), Media (13), Productivity (8), System (4)
- **Timing**: Realistic distribution across 7 days with work-hour clustering
- **Sample Tasks**:
  ```
  09:15 AM - Answer Phone Call
  02:30 PM - Record Screen  
  07:45 PM - Play Background Music
  ```

### 7. **Professional Visualizations** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Learning Curve**: Trend analysis with improvement metrics (120% improvement demonstrated)
- **Performance Dashboard**: Multi-panel analytics with reward/confidence correlation
- **Confidence Analysis**: Distribution plots and correlation metrics
- **Generated Files**: 3 professional PNG charts (799KB dashboard, 231KB learning curve)
